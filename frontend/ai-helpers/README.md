# AI-Helpers for Next.js Development

This directory contains helper scripts developed to fix common issues with Next.js development, especially on Windows systems.

## Next.js Watchpack TypeError Fix

These scripts address the common error in Next.js development server:

```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "to" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
    at Object.relative (node:path:547:5)
    at Watchpack.<anonymous> ([...]/setup-dev-bundler.js:1420:55)
```

### Available Scripts

1. **direct-fix.js** - Simple script that directly patches the problematic file
2. **next-watchpack-fix.js** - Comprehensive fix with multiple patching strategies
3. **start-fixed-server.js** - All-in-one script that fixes the issue and starts the server
4. **start-dev.ps1** - PowerShell script with automatic Node process cleanup

## Usage

Always run npm commands from the `frontend` directory, not the root directory:

```bash
# Apply the fix only
node ai-helpers/direct-fix.js

# Fix the issue and start the development server
node ai-helpers/start-fixed-server.js

# Using npm scripts
npm run dev:fix      # Start with fixes applied
npm run dev:clean    # Clear cache, then start with fixes 
npm run patch:next   # Only apply the fix

# One-liner PowerShell command (recommended)
Stop-Process -Name node -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; npm run dev
```

## Batch Files (in root directory)

- **START-FIXED-DEV-SERVER.bat** - Uses PowerShell to kill Node processes and start the server
- **START-DEV-POWERSHELL.bat** - Uses PowerShell script with additional cleanup

## How It Works

The scripts patch the problematic file in the Next.js installation by adding null checks to the second argument of `path.relative()` calls. This prevents the TypeError from occurring when watching certain files.

The fix is applied to:
- `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/router-utils/setup-dev-bundler.js`

## Repository

These scripts are part of the [ai-helpers-nexus/next-watchpack-fix](https://github.com/ai-helpers-nexus/next-watchpack-fix) repository.

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. Delete the `.next` directory: `rm -rf .next`
2. Kill any running Node.js processes with: `Stop-Process -Name node -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`
3. Try using a different port: `node ai-helpers/start-fixed-server.js 3001`
4. Reinstall Next.js: `npm install next@14.0.4 --save-exact`
5. Run the fix script again: `node ai-helpers/direct-fix.js`
