# üß™ Experimental Marketplace Components

This directory contains experimental marketplace components extracted from the "beef" marketplace implementation, designed for evaluation and potential integration into the main Nibiru codebase.

## üìÅ Current Structure

- `/components` - Enhanced marketplace components
  - `EnhancedServiceCard.tsx` - Improved service card with multiple layout options and expanded features
  - `EnhancedServiceGrid.tsx` - Flexible grid system with featured items support
- `/products` - Sample marketplace product data
  - `devcontrol.json` - Example product listing with tier pricing model

## üóÇÔ∏è Extracted Content

The following files were extracted and adapted from the `/beef` marketplace implementation:

- `/products/devcontrol.json` - Simplified from `/beef/marketplace/products/devcontrol/listing.json`
- `/components/EnhancedServiceCard.tsx` - Based on concepts from beef's marketplace product cards
- `/components/EnhancedServiceGrid.tsx` - Based on beef's marketplace layout patterns

## üß† Components Overview

### EnhancedServiceCard

An improved version of the existing `ServiceCard` component with:

- Auto-categorization based on product content

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- Wishlist functionality
- Compare products feature

## üîç Implementation Strategy

1. Evaluate these components in isolation
2. Test with sample product data
3. Address any integration challenges
4. Incrementally replace existing components
5. Expand feature set based on user feedback

## üóëÔ∏è Safe to Delete vs. Keep

**Safe to Delete:**
- `/beef` directory - All essential concepts have been extracted
- Development artifacts in this directory (e.g., temporary test files)

**Important to Keep:**
- All files in this experimental directory until Phase 2 implementation is complete
- `devcontrol.json` - Used as a reference for the expanded product schema

## üîÑ Integration Notes

- `devcontrol.json` is expected to integrate with a new product listings data layer in Phase 2
- The product schema will be used to create a TypeScript interface in `frontend/types/marketplace.ts`
- The tiered pricing model will be implemented in the product API endpoints (`/api/products/[id]`)
- This expanded schema will enable advanced filtering and dynamic product page generation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- These components are for evaluation only and not yet integrated into the main application
- All enhancements preserve backward compatibility with existing data structures
- New features are implemented as opt-in to minimize disruption
